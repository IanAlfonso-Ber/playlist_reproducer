# 🎵 Music Player App – MIT App Inventor Project

This is a mobile **music player app** developed using **MIT App Inventor**. The app features a menu screen with **14 different songs**, each represented by a button. When a user taps a song button, they are taken to a dedicated **info screen** showing:
- Song name  
- Artist  
- Duration  
- Two buttons: one to **play** the song, and one to **return** to the main menu

This project helped me explore multi-screen design, media components, and interactive layouts in mobile development.
